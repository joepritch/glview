current issues:

code might need to be restructured

need to add translation (right now translation is being handled by pan handler and state)

need to add rotation

need to add scale

need to add matrices

need to add cross platform controls

need to learn how to render points and lines

final goal is to supply a list of data and generate a graph based on said data

graphs include point and line, bar, pie, 3d planes, 3d bar, 3d pie,
